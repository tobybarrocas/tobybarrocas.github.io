<h2> Grandparents </h2>

    <p style="line-height: 2;"> My mother's parents Seine and Moises, on the left, both fled Europe in the 1940s and met in Cuba where they then moved to Puerto Rico and raised my mother and grandchildren only 2 houses down from me. My father's parents Clara and Gaston, on the right, moved from Cuba to Los Angeles and eventually ended up staying there and raised their family. I am so thankful and blessed to have grown up with all four of my grandparents. 

<h2> Direct Family </h2> 
    <p style="line-height: 2;"> We are a family of five. For us, family is everything - I have heard my father and mother preach this my entire life. We are a very active family, we enjoy going on bike rides, the beach, playing sports, and the casual movie night. I owe everything to my two loving parents - Susan and Sal, and my siblings - Nicole and Stuart.
