<h2> ARROZ CON POLLO </h2>

    <p style="line-height: 2;"> Arroz con Pollo is a traditional dish of rice and chicken. Although it is traditionally Spanish the Arroz con Pollo that my mom makes is unmatchable. She incorporates ingredients from both my Puerto Rican heritage as well as my Middle Eastern one. This is my favorite dish.
