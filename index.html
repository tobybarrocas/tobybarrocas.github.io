<h2> Who is Toby? </h2>
     
      <p style="line-height: 2;"> Hello! My name is Toby Barrocas and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison! I was born on October 14, 1999 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Being Puerto Rican is a very big part of who I am as a person. You see, I come from a place where everything is celebrated; a community where everyone and everything matters. Despite our small size, we are immensely proud of our island and our culture. An accepting community that makes me feel safe to say that I am Jewish, and that I am proud to be a Puerto Rican Jew.I graduated from Saint John's School (high school) in 2018 and elected to go on a gap year in Israel; I spent 9 months in Israel splitting my time evenly between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. During this time I also had the opportunity to travel parts of Europe and Africa that have left a lasting impact on me.
